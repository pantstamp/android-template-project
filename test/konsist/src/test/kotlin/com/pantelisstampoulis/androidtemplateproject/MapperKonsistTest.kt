/**
 * CLAUDE.md states that mappers declare what they map in their type. That rule lived only in
 * prose until this test existed, which is why [PR #14][pr] merged a mapper that violated it —
 * the review caught it, nothing enforced it, and it survived the merge.
 *
 * The rule takes the name at its word: a class called `*Mapper` maps one model to another and
 * says so by implementing a mapper interface. Anything doing a different job should carry a
 * different name rather than an exemption here — `ErrorClassifier` is the worked example,
 * since it turns a `NetworkResult` envelope into an error category rather than mapping model
 * to model.
 *
 * The interface is matched by its `Mapper` suffix rather than against a fixed list, because a
 * mapper interface does not have to live in `:architecture:mapper`. That module holds only the
 * boundaries that outlive an implementation choice; a mapping between a `DbModel` and a
 * library-specific type belongs to the module implementing it.
 *
 * [pr]: https://github.com/pantstamp/android-template-project/pull/14
