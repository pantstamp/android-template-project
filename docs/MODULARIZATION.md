# Modularization

Here you will explore the modularization strategy of the Android Template app.

### Why Multi-Module?

* Developers can work on specific sections of the application without slowing down other developers.
* Maintainability: All files are organized in their respective modules, making it easier to locate what we're looking for.
* Incremental Compilation: Modifying a file allows modularized apps to compile faster compared to monolithic apps.
* CI/CD processes run faster.
